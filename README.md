## Description
Tic Tac Toe, in italian Filetto or Tris, is a two players game dates back to ancient Rome. The players marks the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. If you place three of the marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row first you win. 
This is a project I made while studying at university to train and learn new C skills. The enemy behavior is really simple and dumb :). In fact, the CPU just places the 'O' mark randomly.

## Rules
The first player is decided by lot. 
You can mark with a 'X' wherever you want, the same for the enemy with a 'O'.
The first player achieving 3 marks in a row wins.
There is a possibility that the field is going to be filled with marks without anyone having won, in this case the game ends in a draw.
At the end of the game, you can decide whether you want to start a new game or close the game.
